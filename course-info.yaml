summary: For foreign language learners, itâ€™s hard to remember new words, which is
  exactly what flashcards are for. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a
  picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can be used to
  remember any sort of data, so if you want to create something useful and enhance
  your programming skills, this project is just right.<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/83</a>
